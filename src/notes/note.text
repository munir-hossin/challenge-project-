Hereâ€™s a plan for creating your Student Counter website with the described functionality using React.js and Tailwind CSS:

Project Structure
Components:

Header: Displays the name of the app and counters.
StudentForm: Form to add new students.
StudentList: Displays the list of students with actions (check, call, delete).
AbsentList: Displays the list of absent students.
State Management:

Use useState for local state:
